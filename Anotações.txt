.p7m (Signed Data with Content):
Contains both the signed data and the digital signature in a single file.
The code reads this file directly because the signature and data are bundled together.
.p7s (Detached Signature):
Contains only the digital signature without the original data.
To verify a .p7s file, you need both the .p7s file (signature) and the original content it signed.
.p7b (Certificate Chain):
Typically contains only the certificate chain (certificates) and not the signature or content.
It is usually used to establish the validity of certificates in the signature chain rather than verifying the actual signature.
